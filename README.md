# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

Iâ€™m a developer who enjoys building **user-facing software** â€” from apps to games!  
ðŸ’» My tech stack right now? Pure vibes ðŸŒŠ â€” experimenting, exploring, and having fun along the way.

### ðŸš€ What Iâ€™m working on
- Improving my **system design** skills
- Developing **good coding habits**
- Refactoring projects for better structure and maintainability

A lot of my code is still a bit messy â€” Iâ€™ve been treating my projects like a **sketchbook** ðŸŽ¨ â€” but Iâ€™m gradually refining it into cleaner, more professional work.
